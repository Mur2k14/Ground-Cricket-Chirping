# Ground-Cricket-Chirping
Thats right, we are talking about cricket, but not the one that involves bat and ball, but the one that will be classified under insect.
Here, this machine learning model is specifically based on a experiment conducted by George W. Pierce who has collected data about the frequency of 
cricket chrips at a specific ground temperature.
This model will aid us in finding the number of times a cricket chirps at a specific temperature as well as the temperature when a cricket's chirp
is at a specific frequency
